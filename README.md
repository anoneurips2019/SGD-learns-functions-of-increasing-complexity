All the code has been executed in google colab, python3.
The dependencies are standard python libraries - numpy, pandas, tensorflow, keras, sklearn, matplotlib. 
Kerad and MNIST were downloaded using keras.datasets.

To execute the code just upload to collab mnist_cifar_info.ipynb, choose Python3 as a kernel and everything should run smoothly.
